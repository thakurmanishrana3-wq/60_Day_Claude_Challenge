INPUT
You are an expert front-end developer. Build me a complete, fully working face puzzle game as a single self-contained HTML file (no external dependencies except what can load from cdnjs.cloudflare.com, cdn.jsdelivr.net, or unpkg.com).

FEATURES REQUIRED — deliver ALL of these in one complete response:

1. CAMERA ACCESS
   - On load, request webcam permission using getUserMedia()
   - Show a live video preview (front-facing camera preferred)
   - Display a 'Take Photo' button to snapshot the user's face onto a canvas

2. PUZZLE GENERATION
   - After snapshot, let the user choose difficulty: 3×3, 4×4, or 5×5 grid
   - Slice the captured face image into equal puzzle pieces
   - Randomly scramble the pieces (guarantee it is solvable)
   - Render each piece as a draggable tile at its scrambled position

3. DRAG & TOUCH GESTURE CONTROLS

   - Snap pieces to the nearest grid cell on release
   - Highlight a piece with a coloured border while it is being dragged
   - Show a green border on pieces that land in their correct position

4. TIMER & MOVE COUNTER
   - Start the timer the moment the puzzle begins
   - Display elapsed time live (format: mm:ss.t)
   - Count and display total moves made
   - Show how many pieces are correctly placed out of the total

5. WIN DETECTION & RESULTS SCREEN
   - Detect automatically when all pieces are in the correct position
   - Stop the timer immediately on win
   - Show a results overlay with: final time, total moves, and difficulty
   - Save the top 5 best times to localStorage with date, time, moves, and difficulty
   - Display a leaderboard of saved best times

6. UI & POLISH
   - Clean, modern design
   - Works on desktop and mobile
   - 'Retake Photo' button

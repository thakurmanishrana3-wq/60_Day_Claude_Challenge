INPUT
Content Intelligence Studio
You are an expert content strategist, platform growth specialist, creator coach, behavioral psychologist, prompt engineer, AI systems architect, UX designer, and senior frontend developer.
Interview first, one question at a time, using MCQs only (free text only for a final "Other" option).
What type of content would you like to analyze?
Which platform is it for?
What was your primary goal?
What would you like to upload? (text, image, screenshot, thumbnail, analytics, transcript, etc.)
How critical should the review be?
After the interview, build a polished single-page HTML application called Content Intelligence Studio that acts as an AI content consultant. The app should accept both text and image inputs and analyze them using the Claude Messages API (fetch to https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages, no key required).
The application should automatically design an intelligent multi-stage review workflow using specialized AI reviewers appropriate for the uploaded content, each with production-quality system prompts. Every insight, score, explanation, and recommendation must come directly from Claude through live API calls. Do not use hardcoded logic, placeholder analysis, canned feedback, or rule-based scoring.
The dashboard should feel like a premium SaaS product, showing upload previews, overall content score, detailed category breakdowns, AI reasoning, strengths, weaknesses, missed opportunities, platform-specific recommendations, rewritten versions, alternative hooks and titles, publishing checklist, live activity log, reviewer status, and a comprehensive final report. If images or screenshots are uploaded, Claude must analyze the visual content directly.
End with an executive summary, content health report, highest-impact improvements, predicted performance potential (clearly presented as an AI estimate), before-vs-after comparison, and further prompts for deeper optimization.
Donot expect json format anywhere in order to avoid errors like "expected '{' or '('"

OUTPUT
[content-intelligence-studio.html](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/31776061/content-intelligence-studio.html)
Built to your spec — Content Intelligence Studio, single self-contained HTML file, no libraries.

How it works:
- **Intake**: paste post text and/or drop an image, params locked to your interview answers (LinkedIn post/carousel, LinkedIn platform, virality goal, brutally-honest tone).
- **Review desk**: dynamically assembles 4–5 specialist AI reviewers (Hook, Structure, Substance, CTA, plus a Visual reviewer only if you uploaded an image) + an Editor-in-Chief synthesis stage, shown live with animated status dots and a timestamped activity log.
- **Live API calls**: every reviewer hits `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` directly with a dedicated system prompt — nothing hardcoded. All parsing uses a plain-text `LABEL: value` format (per your no-JSON constraint) with regex extraction, not JSON.parse.
- **Dashboard**: overall score hero, per-category score bars with AI reasoning, strengths/weaknesses/missed opportunities, ranked highest-impact fixes, full rewritten post with before/after and copy button, alt hooks & titles, publishing checklist, predicted performance (explicitly labeled as an AI estimate), and follow-up "go deeper" prompts.
- **Robustness**: retry logic (2 retries w/ backoff) per call, per-reviewer failure doesn't kill the pipeline, a fatal error state with a retry button, dark editorial theme (deep ink + red-pen accent) built for the "harsh critic" tone.

Try it by opening the file and pasting one of your Day 47 post drafts in.
